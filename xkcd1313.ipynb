Could Randall have made an error?  Is someone [wrong](http://xkcd.com/386/) on the Internet? Investigating the [1856 election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1856), I see that Randall must have had Millard Fillmore, the third-party candidate, listed as the opponent. Fillmore is of course more famous, having served as the 13th president (although he never won an election; he became president when Taylor died in office). But Fillmore only got 8 electoral votes in 1856 and Fremont got 114, so I will stick with Fremont in *my* list of losers. \n",

      "- Each component regex must match at least one winner, but no losers.\n",
      "- Our solution will be formed by \"or\"-ing together some of these components (e.g. `\"bu|n.e|j\"`).\n",
      "- This is a [set cover problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem): pick some of the components so that when we \"or\" them together they cover all the winners.\n",
      "- Set cover is an NP-hard problem, so I feel justified in using an approximation approach that finds a small but not necessarily smallest solution.\n",
      "- A good approximation can be had with a [greedy algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm): Pick the \"best\" component first (the one that covers the most winners with the fewest characters), and repeat, choosing the \"best\" each time until there are no more winners to cover.\n",
      "- To guarantee that we will find a solution, make sure that each winner has at least one component that matches it, but matches no losers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that there are four ways in which this strategy can fail to find the shortest possible regex:\n",
      "\n",
      "- We are limiting the solution to be a disjunction: a regex of the form `\"a|b|c|...\"`.  If there is a shorter regex that is not a disjunction, we can't find it.  \n",
      "- We start with a restricted pool of components regexes.  If a best regex component is not in the pool, we can't find it.\n",
      "- The greedy algorithm is inherently sub-optimal on some inputs.  \n",
      "- The tradeoff I make between the number of winners covered by a component (more is good) and the number of characters in the component (more is bad) may be the wrong tradeoff.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the solutions end up looking bad, we can always go back and address one or more of these four issues.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The algorithm is below.  We create an initial pool with `regex_components(winners, losers)`, and will accumulate components into the list `solution`, which starts empty. On each iteration choose the best component: the one with a maximum score.  (I decided to score 4 points for each winner matched minus one point for each character in the component. The function `matches(regex, strings)` returns a set of the strings that match.)  We then add the best component to `solution`, and remove from winners all the strings that are matched by `best`.  Finally, we update the pool, keeping only those components that still match one or more of the remaining winners. When there are no more winners left, OR together all the solution components to give the final regular expression string."
